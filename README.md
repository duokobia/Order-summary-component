## Overview
This is my sixth Frontend Mentor challenge. The task is undertaken with an intent to improve my frontend development skills as a junior frontend developer.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size

## My process

A sketch was used to approximate dimensions and how to set up the flex layout. Remote git repository was created for the project before development commenced.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first approach 

### What I learned

Using utility classes in the HTML, as in Tailwind approach, was fun. With this approach, I had to almost rewrite the stylesheet for media queries. I could not make mobile screens inherit the desktop properties easily. Achieving this for me is easier when I use CSS Grid for the container. I could not use clamp() property to make banner responsive across a wide range of screen sizes as expected.

Despite the struggles, I still found this project interesting. I am eager to improve my frontend development skills by working on more projects in order to write cleaner and more efficient codes. 

I will appreciate and welcome all suggestions please.



### Continued development

- use clamp() for responsiveness of banners. 
- better naming convention used for future projects such as BEM.
- Media query with advanced website layouts.
- writing cleaner, scalable and easy to maintain code.
- use common frameworks such as Tailwind and Bootstrap for future projects.
