## Overview
This is my sixth Frontend Mentor challenge. The task is undertaken with an intent to improve my frontend development skills as a junior frontend developer.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size

## My process

A sketch was used to approximate dimensions and how to set up the flex layout. Remote git repository was created for the project before development commenced.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first approach 

### What I learned

Desktop first approach was used with an intent to reduce lines of code required for media query for mobile screens. I tried writing a minimalistic code for the media query like I do with CSS Grid but could not achieve that in this sprint. I think it was because I used flexbox. I also tried using clamp for responsiveness but could not achieve much with that as well. Utility classes was used in the HTML like in Tailwind. 

I found this project interesting and am opened to learning better ways of improving my coding skill. 


### Continued development

- use common frameworks such as Tailwind and Bootstrap for future projects.
- better naming convention used for future projects such as BEM.
- Media query with advanced website layouts.
- writing cleaner, scalable and easy to maintain code.
