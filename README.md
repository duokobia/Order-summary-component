## Overview
This is my sixth Frontend Mentor challenge. The task is undertaken with an intent to improve my frontend development skills as a junior frontend developer.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size

## My process

A sketch was used to approximate dimensions and how to set up the flex layout. Remote git repository was created for the project before development commenced.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first approach 

### What I learned

Utility classes were used in the HTML like in Tailwind. With this approach, I had to almost rewrite the the stylesheet for mobile screens. It refused to inherit the desktop properties. Achieving this for me is easier with CSS Grid than flexbox. I struggled to reduce the media query code with this approach. Using clamp() for the width of the container to make banner responsiveness did not work as expected too. 

Despite the struggles, I still found this project interesting and am opened to learning better ways of improving my coding skill. 



### Continued development

- use clamp() for responsiveness of banners. 
- better naming convention used for future projects such as BEM.
- Media query with advanced website layouts.
- writing cleaner, scalable and easy to maintain code.
- use common frameworks such as Tailwind and Bootstrap for future projects.
